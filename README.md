# Iris Species Classification

This project is part of the CodeAlpha initiative and focuses on the classification of Iris species using machine learning techniques. The main language used in this project is Jupyter Notebook.

## Introduction

The Iris species classification project aims to classify Iris flowers into different species based on various features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate classification results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of Iris flowers with four features each. The dataset is divided into three classes, each representing a different species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:
